kodus/mail
==========

Simple services for sending e-mail.


### Usage

TODO


### Integration Test

To run the integration tests, you will need to set up a local SMTP server for testing.

On Windows, try [http://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/](SMTP4Dev).

On Linux, you will likely just have to set up an actual, local SMTP daemon. (Have fun with that!)

You may need to copy `integration.suite.dist.yml` to `integration.suite.yml` to customize the
SMTP host-name, port-number, etc.
